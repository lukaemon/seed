According to Page's wife, the ex-champ died from complications due to boxing injuries and paralysis. Following a successful amateur career, Page went 58-17-1 during a professional career that began in 1979 and included wins over Jimmy Young, James Tillis, Renaldo Snipes, Gerrie Coetzee (for the WBA title), James 'Bonecrusher' Smith and Tim Witherspoon. Page's losses read like a who's who of heavyweights of the 1980s: Trevor Berbick, Witherspoon, Tony Tubbs, Buster Douglas, Joe Bugner, Orlin Norris, Donovan 'Razor' Ruddock, Bruce Seldon, Monte Barrett and Jorge Luis Gonzalez.
