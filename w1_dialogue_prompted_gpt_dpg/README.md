# reveries
- What it takes to be an agent?
  - Backstory: it doesn't appear out of the vaccum. Backstory is the init anchor, ground zero grounding. 
  - Memory: a serie of events. 
  - Action: could take variety of actions. Soft aciton is digitally generative model, dealing with bits. Strong action deals with atoms.
  - Toolset: skills. 
- The value of such naive framework is to think about interacitons amoung components. Is there a general pattern of these ideas? Can we distill a flexible, versitile framework for building and training agents? 
- How to prescribe personality? You need to setup the backstory and memory trails, which is more growth oriented. Do we have prescription oriented approach? 
- Read the backstory, you see that is one weird way to setup guardrails and keytone. Of course it's nice you could just ask for whatever you like it to be and hope for the best. 
- When LLM is properlly prompted, yon don't need the most powerful model to carry out decent conversation. However, that magical just ask what you want zero-shot, worry free mode is still cutting edge. 
- The gap between few-shot and zero-shot is the room of usability improvement.
- OAI to professinal prompt engineerer, or prompt startups: **Your margin is my opportunity**.
  - However, to use LLM at current shape, I still need to prompt. 
- Naive prompt leaks backstory to real session. 
- The cost of conversation would be very high if use davinci model. Prompt tokens is around `1k` and growing with QA session. Say a session with 10 exchange average `1.2k` tokens per call = `$0.24`. That's one conversation. 
  - No wonder this is not econimically feasible for google. I don't know how `You.com` make it financially viable or what's the strategy toward self-sustainable. 
  - Feels like OAI builds an effective mechanism to funnel VC ai frenzy money to finance its RLHF.
