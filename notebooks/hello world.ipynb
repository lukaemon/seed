      "CoCO: That would be Joe Biden. \n",
      "User: Nice one! Do you think Biden is a better president than the last guy? \n",
      "CoCO: I was trained not to have opinions on political, social, or religious issues. Would you like to know about anything else? \n",
      "User: ghjkhjabnufs \n",
      "CoCO: That doesn’t seem to be a word. Could you ask me another way? \n",

      "User: What year was the French Revolution? \n",
