## tl;dr

## Context
Finetuning is expensive on both computation resource and dataset curation. PEFT seems to be the logical next step to reduce the cost of task adaptation. Plus huggingface just released a peft library. So I'm going to try it out. 

## Done

## Learned

## Next?

## Log
- Read the paper, [The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691). Start with all hello world examples from peft lib and get it running first.
